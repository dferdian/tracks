    Hey Guys,
    
    Is the following possible for a demo for Sebastien Wednesday afternoon?
    
    From workout programs page:
    * Click on iTread - show the new HTML layout for iTread (picture on the right, workout programs and all content pulled from the database)
    * Click on iSwim - show the new HTML layout for iSwim (video on the top, workout programs and all content pulled from the database)
    * Prices for workout programs to show based on type of user plan.  For instance (50% off Natalie content if you are a monthly motivator)
    
    Matt

  notes: "Goal of task force is to come up with a solution for class size problem.  How are they going to address this?  They don\xE2\x80\x99t know how they are going to get to smaller class sizes.  Tony thinks he can get all the schools at 75% capacity on average across the school district.  Nobody disagrees with the law, but nobody knows how to solve the problem.  The state may be willing to pay for this.  One other potential opportunity is to go to the state commitee in charge of the concurrency law (K-4 can only have 18 students. 4-8 22.  25 in high school core classes).  Task force has students, teachers, administrators, and parents. "

    Hi Mark,
    
    Can you, Sandy, or Tricia put together a calendar of key Y events for me, and let me know which ones we will be attending/speaking and/or sponsoring based on your conversations with Bill.  I want to get better visibility into our plans for conference attendance for the year.
    
    Thanks
    Matt

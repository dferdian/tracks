    South Hampton Roads Thoughts on DAXKO from Bill's conversation with Chuck Harris
    ****************************************************************************************
    Chuck Harris wants to measure association level satisfaction on a monthly basis.  Chuck Harris wants us to work with DAXKO on this.
    South Hampton Roads is having issues with bringing DAXKO to its knees.
    Chuck Harris has put together a great set of reports.
    Bill has copies of South Hampton Roads reports from DAXKO system.
    DAXKO can only do a 6 month lookback on financials
    
    South Hampton Roads has at least 100,000 former members.  He doesn't know which ones are likely to cycle back.  Which might be active alumni, how many there are of the various types.
